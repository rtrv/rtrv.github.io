# Hi, I'm Artem

This is my public Dendron vault published over GitHub Pages. I collect notes about #software-engineering, #engineering-management, #devops and #technology

I used to be a software development engineer for about 10 years and then a couple of years I was an engineering manager.

At some point I started to be overwhelmed with the amount of data in my life, especially related to IT. I've been diagnosed with ADHD, which brings some complexities when I need to focus for quite long time. And I've chosen to publicly post everything related to my profession to be able to access and share this information anytime. Even when I'm dead one day, which is the first case to think about in terms of risk management.
