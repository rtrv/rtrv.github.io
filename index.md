Hi, I'm Artem. This is my public knowledge base. I collect notes about software engineering, engineering management, devops and technology

I started my carreer as a software development engineer about 13 years ago and I was an engineering manager for a couple of years.

At some point I started to be overwhelmed with the amount of data in my life, especially related to IT. I've been diagnosed with ADHD, which brings some complexities when I need to focus for quite long time. And I've chosen to publicly post everything related to my profession to be able to access and share this information anytime. Even when I'm dead one day, which is the first case to think about in terms of risk management.

My goal is to describe things in a simple way, when each topic is covered within 5 minutes, but also is full of links. That means each note should be about 500-600 words at most.

I'm looking for a job right now and you may check [my CV]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link cv.md %}).
